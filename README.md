# systemd-workshop

The main goal of this workshop is to introduce various aspects of systemd to
all of you who haven't used it extensively yet.

## Requirements

Our main requirement is having Linux distribution with systemd version at least
**229**. It might be installed on some virtual machine on your laptop. Just
make sure it works and running following command returns required systemd
version:

```
$ systemctl --version
systemd 229
```

You may install [Fedora 24](https://getfedora.org/) (server or workstation
edition) - it already has systemd 229 installed.

## Agenda

### systemd-bin (1h)

During this part we'll discover various binaries provided by systemd and use
some ot those:

```
systemd-path                  
systemd-detect-virt             systemd-resolve               
systemctl                       systemd-escape                  systemd-run                   
systemd-analyze                 systemd-firstboot
systemd-ask-password
systemd-sysusers              
systemd-bus-proxy               systemd-inhibit
systemd-timesync              
systemd-cat                     systemd-machine-id-setup
systemd-tmpfiles              
systemd-cgls                    systemd-network
systemd-cgtop                   systemd-notify                                                
systemd-coredump                systemd-nspawn                                                
```

### unit files (2h)

description TODO

### journald (1h)

Here be dragons. We'll dive into specifics of managing logs with journald.
Starting with reading logs and finishing on creating very specific queries. If
there's enough time maybe we'll try to push logs to central repository?

### systemd-nspawn (2h)

description TODO

### developing systemd - aware apps (until you die)

We'll learn how to integrate Python (and maybe C and Java?) applications with 
systemd making systemd aware of applications state. Thanks to that application 
implementing functionalities like automated failover, restart and other
emergency actions will be done without manual intervention and in a clear, and
proper way.
